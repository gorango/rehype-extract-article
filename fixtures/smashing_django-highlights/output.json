As one of the primary components of a dynamic web application, the “user account” object, like the wheel, is tempting to re-invent, but the standard shape is appropriate for most uses.

Django provides a powerful out-of-the-box user model, and in this article, we’ll walk through the best way to provide secure, intuitive user authentication flows.<p>There are two types of websites: static and dynamic. <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com\">Django</a> is a framework for developing dynamic websites. While a static website is one that solely presents information, there is no interaction (beyond simple page requests) that gets registered to a server. In a static website, the server sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a client and that’s it. More capabilities require a dynamic website, where the server stores information and responds to user interaction beyond just serving pages. One major reason to develop a dynamic site is to authenticate users and restrict content.</p><p>Writing, deploying, and administering a static website is about an order of magnitude easier, cheaper, and more secure than a dynamic site. Thus, you should only create a dynamic website if the dynamic paradigm’s additional capabilities are necessary for your project. Django simplifies and streamlines the process of creating a dynamic site with its built-in components. As one of the primary components of a dynamic web application, the “user account” object, like the wheel, is tempting to re-invent, but the standard shape is appropriate for most uses. Django provides a powerful out-of-the-box user model, and in this article, we’ll walk through the best way to provide secure, intuitive user authentication flows.</p><h3>Getting Set Up</h3><p>If you’d like to create your own Django application to experiment with the concepts in this article, you can create a directory (and preferably a virtual environment) and then run the following commands:</p><pre><code>pip install django\\ndjango-admin startproject PROJECTNAME\\ncd PROJECTNAME\\npython manage.py startapp APPNAME\\npython manage.py migrate\\npython manage.py runserver\\n</code></pre><p><em>If you’re looking for a walkthrough of creating your first Django project, <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/\">Django’s own website provides a great one</a>. In this article, we’re not using an example project, but the concepts discussed will apply to almost every Django application.</em></p><h3>Standard User Model</h3><p>Fundamentally, the concept of a user account exists for two reasons: access control and personalized application state. Access control is the idea that resources on a system are only available to some users. Personalized state is heavily dependent on the purpose of the application but may include settings, data, or any other records specific to an individual user. The Django stock <code>User</code> model provides sensible approaches to both use cases.</p><p>Initially, there are two types of users in a Django application: superuser accounts and regular users. Superusers have every attribute and privilege of regular accounts, but also have access to the Django admin panel, a powerful application that we’ll explore in detail in a future article. Essentially, superusers can create, edit, or delete any data in the application, including other user accounts.</p><blockquote><p><a aria-label=\"Share on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/share?text=Fundamentally,%20the%20concept%20of%20a%20user%20account%20exists%20for%20two%20reasons:%20access%20control%20and%20personalized%20application%20state.%0a&#x26;url=https://smashingmagazine.com%2f2020%2f02%2fdjango-highlights-user-models-authentication%2f\">Fundamentally, the concept of a user account exists for two reasons: access control and personalized application state.</a></p></blockquote><p>To create a superuser on your own Django application, run:</p><p>The other benefit of a user account is storing personalized data to the database. By default, Django only requires a username and password but provides optional fields for users to enter their first name, last name, and email address. You can read a <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/default/\">complete model reference on the Django website</a>. We’ll discuss extending this model below.</p><h4>Security And Reliability</h4><p>Django includes substantial password management middleware with the user model. User passwords are required to be at least 8 characters, not entirely numbers, not match too closely to the username, and not be on a list of the 20,000 most common passwords. The Django stock forms validate these requirements. When a password is sent to the server, it is encrypted before it is stored, by default using the PBKDF2 algorithm with a SHA256 hash. Overall, the default password system provides robust security without any effort from the developer. Unless you have specific expertise and a compelling reason to change the way passwords are handled in your application, don’t modify this behavior.</p><p>One other convenient built-in is the requirement that usernames are unique. If you think about it, if there were two users with the username “djangofan1” and the server received a login request for that username it would not know which user was trying to access the application. Unfortunately for them, the second user to try to register with “djangofan1” will have to pick a different name, perhaps “djangofan2”. This uniqueness constraint is enforced at the database level but is again verified by the forms that Django provides.</p><p>Finally, a note on deleting users. While deleting users is a possibility, most complex applications will have a number of resources tied to each user account. If you want to effectively delete a user without removing those attached objects, set the user’s <code>is_active</code> field to false instead. Then, those other resources remain associated with the account rather than being deleted themselves, and the user account is able to be re-activated at any time by a superuser. Note that this does not free up the username, but setting the account as inactive in conjunction with changing the username to a random, unique value could achieve the same effect.

Earlier issues.\n\nOne major reason to develop a dynamic site is to authenticate users and restrict content. Django provides a powerful out-of-the-box user model, and in this article, we’ll walk through the best way to provide secure, intuitive user authentication flows.\n\nThere are two types of websites: static and dynamic. Django is a framework for developing dynamic websites. While a static website is one that solely presents information, there is no interaction (beyond simple page requests) that gets registered to a server. In a static website, the server sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a client and that’s it. More capabilities require a dynamic website, where the server stores information and responds to user interaction beyond just serving pages. One major reason to develop a dynamic site is to authenticate users and restrict content.\n\nWriting, deploying, and administering a static website is about an order of magnitude easier, cheaper, and more secure than a dynamic site. Thus, you should only create a dynamic website if the dynamic paradigm’s additional capabilities are necessary for your project. Django simplifies and streamlines the process of creating a dynamic site with its built-in components. As one of the primary components of a dynamic web application, the “user account” object, like the wheel, is tempting to re-invent, but the standard shape is appropriate for most uses. Django provides a powerful out-of-the-box user model, and in this article, we’ll walk through the best way to provide secure, intuitive user authentication flows.\n\nGetting Set Up\n\nIf you’d like to create your own Django application to experiment with the concepts in this article, you can create a directory (and preferably a virtual environment) and then run the following commands:\n\npip install django\\ndjango-admin startproject PROJECTNAME\\ncd PROJECTNAME\\npython manage.py startapp APPNAME\\npython manage.py migrate\\npython manage.py runserver\\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a walkthrough of creating your first Django project, Django’s own website provides a great one. In this article, we’re not using an example project, but the concepts discussed will apply to almost every Django application.\n\nStandard User Model\n\nFundamentally, the concept of a user account exists for two reasons: access control and personalized application state. Access control is the idea that resources on a system are only available to some users. Personalized state is heavily dependent on the purpose of the application but may include settings, data, or any other records specific to an individual user. The Django stock User model provides sensible approaches to both use cases.\n\nInitially, there are two types of users in a Django application: superuser accounts and regular users. Superusers have every attribute and privilege of regular accounts, but also have access to the Django admin panel, a powerful application that we’ll explore in detail in a future article. Essentially, superusers can create, edit, or delete any data in the application, including other user accounts.\n\nFundamentally, the concept of a user account exists for two reasons: access control and personalized application state.\n\nTo create a superuser on your own Django application, run:\n\nThe other benefit of a user account is storing personalized data to the database. By default, Django only requires a username and password but provides optional fields for users to enter their first name, last name, and email address. You can read a complete model reference on the Django website. We’ll discuss extending this model below.\n\nSecurity And Reliability\n\nDjango includes substantial password management middleware with the user model. User passwords are required to be at least 8 characters, not entirely numbers, not match too closely to the username, and not be on a list of the 20,000 most common passwords. The Django stock forms validate these requirements. When a password is sent to the server, it is encrypted before it is stored, by default using the PBKDF2 algorithm with a SHA256 hash. Overall, the default password system provides robust security without any effort from the developer. Unless you have specific expertise and a compelling reason to change the way passwords are handled in your application, don’t modify this behavior.\n\nOne other convenient built-in is the requirement that usernames are unique. If you think about it, if there were two users with the username “djangofan1” and the server received a login request for that username it would not know which user was trying to access the application. Unfortunately for them, the second user to try to register with “djangofan1” will have to pick a different name, perhaps “djangofan2”. This uniqueness constraint is enforced at the database level but is again verified by the forms that Django provides.\n\nFinally, a note on deleting users. While deleting users is a possibility, most complex applications will have a number of resources tied to each user account. If you want to effectively delete a user without removing those attached objects, set the user’s is_active field to false instead. Then, those other resources remain associated with the account rather than being deleted themselves, and the user account is able to be re-activated at any time by a superuser. Note that this does not free up the username, but setting the account as inactive in conjunction with changing the username to a random, unique value could achieve the same effect. Finally, if your site policies or applicable local law require that user accounts be fully deletable, the is_active approach will not be sufficient.\n\nUnless you have specific expertise and a compelling reason to change the way passwords are handled in your application, don’t modify this behavior.\n\nStandard Use\n\nWhen you want to register a new user account, the view for doing so will probably look something like the following in views.py:\n\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\\nfrom django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login\\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\\n\\ndef signup(request):\\n    if request.user.is_authenticated:\\n        return redirect(\\'/\\')\\n    if request.method == \\'POST\\':\\n        form = UserCreationForm(request.POST)\\n        if form.is_valid():\\n            form.save()\\n            username = form.cleaned_data.get(\\'username\\')\\n            password = form.cleaned_data.get(\\'password1\\')\\n            user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)\\n            login(request, user)\\n            return redirect(\\'/\\')\\n        else:\\n            return render(request, \\'signup.html\\', {\\'form\\': form})\\n    else:\\n        form = UserCreationForm()\\n        return render(request, \\'signup.html\\', {\\'form\\': form})\\n\n\nLet’s break that down:\n\nIf the user is already signed in, we’ll redirect them away from the signup page.\n\nIf the request method is POST, that means that the form for creating a user has already been filled out and it’s time to create a user.\n\nFirst, construct the form object on the backend with the user-provided data.\n\nIf the form is valid, create the user and log them in, then send them to the main page.\n\nOtherwise, dump them back on the user creation page with information about what data was invalid (for example, they requested a username already in use).\n\nOtherwise, the user is accessing the page for the first time and should be met with the form for creating a new account.\n\nNow examining account signin:\n\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\\nfrom django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login\\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import AuthenticationForm\\n\\ndef signin(request):\\n    if request.user.is_authenticated:\\n        return render(request, \\'homepage.html\\')\\n    if request.method == \\'POST\\':\\n        username = request.POST[\\'username\\']\\n        password = request.POST[\\'password\\']\\n        user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)\\n        if user is not None:\\n            login(request, user)\\n            return redirect(\\'/\\')\\n        else:\\n            form = AuthenticationForm(request.POST)\\n            return render(request, \\'signin.html\\', {\\'form\\': form})\\n    else:\\n        form = AuthenticationForm()\\n        return render(request, \\'signin.html\\', {\\'form\\': form})\\n\n\nAnother breakdown:\n\nIf the user is already signed in, we’ll redirect them away from the sign-in page.\n\nIf the request method is POST, that means that the form for signing in has been filled and it’s time to authenticate the user to an account.\n\nFirst, authenticate the user with the user-provided data\n\nIf the username and password correspond to an account, log the user in\n\nOtherwise, bring them back to the sign-in page with their form information pre-filled\n\nOtherwise, the user is accessing the page for the first time and should be met with the form for logging in.\n\nFinally, your users may eventually want to sign out. The basic code for this request is simple:\n\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\\nfrom django.contrib.auth import logout\\n\\ndef signout(request):\\n    logout(request)\\n    return redirect(\\'/\\')\\n\n\nOnce the user has been logged in to their account, and until they log out on that device, they are having a “session.” During this time, subsequent requests from their browser will be able to access account-only pages. A user can have multiple sessions active at the same time. By default, sessions do not time out.\n\nWhile a user has an active session on their device, they will register as True for the request.user.is_authenticated check. Another way to restrict pages to logged-in users only is the @login_required decorator above a function. There are multiple other ways of achieving the same, detailed here.\n\nIf this level of configuration is more than you want to perform, there is an even more out-of-the-box approach to user management.
